# AIBS_synapse
This repoository includes NEST implementatons of our STP synapses. The former NEST model was constructed for NEST-2.14.0, but it does not work for NEST-2.16.0 due to the changes introduced to its kernel. Specficially, the NEST kernel no longer carries the information about the time of the last spike. This repository now just includes NEST-2.16.0 version. The earlier version will also be made available here since it is now being used in one of our modelling efforts.
